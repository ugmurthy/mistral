However, one of the most famous marathoners globally is Eliud Kipchoge from Kenya. He is the current world record holder in the marathon, Olympic champion, and the first person to run a marathon in under two hours (although it was not an official world record due to certain conditions). Other notable marathoners include Haile Gebrselassie, Paula Radcliffe, and Abebe Bikila.",
